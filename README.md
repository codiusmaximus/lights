## 1. Solving your first linear program in Python

The notebook cake.ipynb contains a full solution of the problem outlined in the article, along with the question posed to the reader, i.e. 'add the equation and break the flour - eggs degeneracy'.

The notebook is written with the following setup

- Python 3.8.2
- SciPy 1.18.1
- Numpy 1.4.1
- Cvxopt 1.2.3 (optional)

## 2. Using linear programs to simulate simultaneous logic 

In prep, stay tuned for the article.
